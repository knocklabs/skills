# Build workflows

1. Build each confirmed **workflow** in the Knock development environment using the Knock MCP tools (workflow, steps, and message templates).
2. If a confirmed item is a **guide** (or knock shape `guide` / `both`), create the guide resource when MCP/CLI allows, but do **not** treat app UI as done and do **not** start `knock-in-app-ui` here — wrap-up will ask the user before that next step.
3. After building, list each created workflow/guide in one line with a link to it in the Knock dashboard.
