# Map concepts to Knock

Use the platform-specific tutorials when they apply:

- [Migrate from Braze](https://docs.knock.app/tutorials/migrate-from-braze)
- [Migrate from Courier](https://docs.knock.app/tutorials/migrate-from-courier)

For everything else, use this generic map and link Knock concept docs in the plan.

## Platform notes

### Braze

Follow the Braze tutorial mapping: campaigns/Canvases → workflows, Content Blocks → partials, custom attributes → user properties, attribute-based "tenants" → Knock tenants where appropriate.

### Courier

Follow the Courier tutorial: Automations + templates → workflows, Lists → subscriptions, Brands/tenants → Knock tenants, Topics → preference categories.

### Customer.io / Iterable / similar

Treat campaigns/journeys as workflows, people as users, attributes as user properties, subscription topics as preference categories. Prefer API-triggered transactional flows first.

### Direct ESP / custom mailer

Each distinct message type (password reset, invite, receipt) → one workflow with an email channel step. Shared header/footer → partials + email layout. Replace direct provider SDK calls with Knock trigger calls after workflows exist.

### Slack / Teams ops alerts

Map to chat channel steps on workflows. Keep recipient logic (channel vs user) explicit in the plan.

## Per-item mapping output

For each inventory row, fill:

```markdown
### [ID] [Name]
- **Today.** …
- **Knock shape.** workflow | guide | feed message | preference-only
- **Channels.** …
- **Trigger.** event / API / audience / schedule
- **Data to pass.** …
- **Preferences.** category or transactional exemption
- **Docs.** links
- **Migration risk.** low | medium | high — why
```
